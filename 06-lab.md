Lab 06 - Text Mining
================

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, include  = FALSE)
```

# Learning goals

  - Use `unnest_tokens()` and `unnest_ngrams()` to extract tokens and
    ngrams from text.
  - Use dplyr and ggplot2 to analyze text data

# Lab description

For this lab we will be working with a new dataset. The dataset contains
transcription samples from <https://www.mtsamples.com/>. And is loaded
and “fairly” cleaned at
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/00_mtsamples/mtsamples.csv>.

This markdown document should be rendered using `github_document`
document.

# Setup the Git project and the GitHub repository

1.  Go to your documents (or wherever you are planning to store the
    data) in your computer, and create a folder for this project, for
    example, “PM566-labs”

2.  In that folder, save [this
    template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/PM566/master/content/assignment/06-lab.Rmd)
    as “README.Rmd”. This will be the markdown file where all the magic
    will happen.

3.  Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository, hopefully of
    the same name that this folder has, i.e., “PM566-labs”.

4.  Initialize the Git project, add the “README.Rmd” file, and make your
    first commit.

5.  Add the repo you just created on GitHub.com to the list of remotes,
    and push your commit to origin while setting the upstream.

### Setup packages

You should load in `dplyr`, (or `data.table` if you want to work that
way), `ggplot2` and `tidytext`. If you don’t already have `tidytext`
then you can install with

### read in Medical Transcriptions

Loading in reference transcription samples from

## Question 1: What specialties do we have?

We can use `count()` from `dplyr` to figure out how many different
catagories do we have? Are these catagories related? overlapping? evenly
distributed?

  - There are 40 categories not being overlapped.

-----

## Question 2

  - Tokenize the the words in the `transcription` column
  - Count the number of times each token appears
  - Visualize the top 20 most frequent words

Explain what we see from this result. Does it makes sense? What insights
(if any) do we get?

  - Most of them are stop words except “patient”. After removing them it
    will show truely interesting words.

-----

## Question 3

  - Redo visualization but remove stopwords before
  - Bonus points if you remove numbers as well

What do we see know that we have removed stop words? Does it give us a
better idea of what the text is about?

  - After removing stop words and numbers, it shows more clear idea.

-----

# Question 4

repeat question 2, but this time tokenize into bi-grams. how does the
result change if you look at tri-grams?

  - Tri-grams looks more sentences that make sense.

-----

# Question 5

Using the results you got from questions 4. Pick a word and count the
words that appears after and before it.

-----

# Question 6

Which words are most used in each of the specialties. you can use
`group_by()` and `top_n()` from `dplyr` to have the calculations be done
within each specialty. Remember to remove stopwords. How about the most
5 used words?

# Question 7 - extra

Find your own insight in the data:

Ideas:

  - Interesting ngrams
  - See if certain words are used more in some specialties then others
